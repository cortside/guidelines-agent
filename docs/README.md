# Guidelines Agent Documentation Index

This folder contains documentation for the Guidelines Agent codebase, intended for both AI-assisted code generation and for engineers who need to read, understand, or modify the code.

## Contents

- [Overview](./overview.md): High-level summary of the project, its structure, and recommendations for enterprise readiness.
- [API Module](./api.md): Details on the backend API, agent logic, and document/prompt/workflow management.
- [Chatbot UI Module](./chatbot-ui.md): Details on the frontend chat interface and its integration with the backend API.

## How to Use

- Start with the [Overview](./overview.md) for a project-wide understanding.
- Refer to module-specific docs for deeper technical details.
- Use this documentation as a foundation for onboarding, code review, and future feature development.

Additional documentation and module-level details should be added here as the codebase matures.
