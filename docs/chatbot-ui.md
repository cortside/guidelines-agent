# Chatbot UI Module Documentation (`chatbot/`)

## Purpose
The `chatbot/` directory contains the frontend web application for interacting with the agent API. It provides a user-friendly chat interface for submitting queries, viewing responses, and managing conversations.

## Main Components

- **src/App.tsx**: Main React component that initializes the application and manages global state.
- **src/components/ChatPage.tsx**: Core chat interface for user-agent interaction.
- **src/components/Sidebar.tsx**: Sidebar navigation and conversation management.
- **src/lib/api.ts**: Handles API requests to the backend agent API.
- **index.html**, **App.css**, **tailwind.config.js**: UI layout, styling, and configuration.
- **Dockerfile**, **k8s-deployment.yaml**, **k8s-service.yaml**: Containerization and Kubernetes deployment configuration.

## Key Concepts

- **React**: The UI is built using React for component-based development and state management.
- **API Integration**: Communicates with the backend agent API for chat functionality.
- **Deployment**: Supports containerized and Kubernetes-based deployment for scalability.

## Current Limitations

- Prototype-level UI; may lack accessibility, responsiveness, and robust error handling.
- Minimal state management and test coverage.

## Recommendations

- Refactor for maintainability and scalability.
- Add UI/UX enhancements and accessibility features.
- Implement robust error handling and user feedback.
- Add end-to-end and component tests.
