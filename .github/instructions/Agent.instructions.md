# Project Context
This project is a TypeScript-based agent that interacts with a vector store to retrieve documents based on
search queries. It uses tools for retrieving information and processing it with a language model. The agent is designed to handle different sections of documents (beginning, middle, end) and to provide relevant responses based on user queries.
