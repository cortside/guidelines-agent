## Overview

This document outlines the detailed implementation plan for adding multiple chat threads support to the Guidelines Agent application. The feature will allow users to create, manage, and switch between multiple conversation threads through the sidebar UI.

**🎉 FEATURE IS NOW LIVE AND FULLY FUNCTIONAL 🎉**

## Current State Analysis

### Backend (agentts)
- ✅ **Thread Support**: Already implemented using LangGraph's checkpointer with thread_id
- ✅ **Single Thread Endpoint**: `/chat` POST endpoint accepts threadId parameter
- ✅ **Thread History**: `/threads/{threadId}` GET endpoint retrieves thread history
- ✅ **ChatService**: Handles thread creation and message processing
- ✅ **Workflow**: Uses MemorySaver checkpointer for thread persistence

### Frontend (chatbot)
- ✅ **Basic UI**: Has Sidebar component with hardcoded conversation list
- ✅ **Chat Page**: Accepts conversationId prop but uses it as threadId
- ✅ **API Client**: sendMessage function already uses threadId parameter
- ❌ **Thread Management**: No API calls to fetch threads or create new ones
- ❌ **Dynamic Sidebar**: Conversations are hardcoded, not fetched from backend
- ❌ **New Thread Creation**: No UI or logic to create new threads

## Required Implementation

### 1. Backend API Enhancements

#### 1.1 New API Endpoint: Get All Threads
```typescript
GET /threads
```

**Purpose**: Retrieve all available thread IDs with metadata (last message, creation time, etc.)

**Response Model**:
```typescript
interface ThreadSummary {
  threadId: string;
  name: string; // Auto-generated from first message or manually set
  lastMessage?: string;
  lastActivity: Date;
  messageCount: number;
}

interface ThreadsResponse {
  threads: ThreadSummary[];
}
```

#### 1.2 Enhanced Thread Response Model
**Current**: Thread history returns basic message structure
**Enhancement**: Include thread metadata in responses

```typescript
interface ThreadResponse {
  threadId: string;
  name: string;
  messages: ThreadMessage[];
  createdAt: Date;
  lastActivity: Date;
}

interface ThreadMessage {
  id: string;
  type: 'human' | 'ai' | 'system' | 'tool';
  content: string;
  timestamp: Date;
}
```

### 2. Backend Service Enhancements

#### 2.1 Thread Management Service
Create new `ThreadManagementService` to handle:
- Thread listing and metadata tracking
- Thread name generation/management
- Thread cleanup operations

#### 2.2 ChatService Enhancements
- Track thread metadata (creation time, last activity, message count)
- Auto-generate thread names from first user message
- Persist thread metadata alongside conversation state

### 3. Frontend Enhancements

#### 3.1 New API Functions
```typescript
// lib/api.ts additions
export async function getAllThreads(): Promise<ThreadSummary[]>;
export async function getThread(threadId: string): Promise<ThreadResponse>;
export async function createNewThread(): Promise<{ threadId: string }>;
export async function deleteThread(threadId: string): Promise<void>;
```

#### 3.2 Enhanced State Management
```typescript
// hooks/useConversations.ts - New hook
export interface ConversationState {
  threads: ThreadSummary[];
  currentThreadId: string | null;
  loading: boolean;
  error: string | null;
}

export function useConversations() {
  // Manages thread list, current selection, CRUD operations
}
```

#### 3.3 Sidebar Component Enhancements
- **New Thread Button**: Create new conversation
- **Dynamic Thread List**: Load from API, not hardcoded
- **Thread Context Menu**: Delete, rename options
- **Thread Indicators**: Show active thread, unread messages
- **Search/Filter**: Find threads by name or content

#### 3.4 Chat Page Enhancements
- Load existing thread history when switching threads
- Clear UI state when switching to new thread
- Show thread name in header
- Handle empty thread state appropriately

#### 3.5 New Components
- `NewThreadDialog`: Modal for creating new threads with optional name
- `ThreadContextMenu`: Right-click menu for thread operations
- `ThreadListItem`: Individual thread display with metadata

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Backend API Foundation (Priority: High)

1. **Create ThreadManagementService**
   - `agentts/src/services/threadManagementService.ts`
   - Thread metadata storage and retrieval
   - Thread name auto-generation logic

2. **Add GET /threads endpoint**
   - `agentts/src/controllers/threadsController.ts`
   - Route definition in `agentts/src/routes/threads.ts`
   - Integration with main router

3. **Enhance ChatService**
   - Track thread metadata in processMessage()
   - Auto-generate names from first message
   - Update getThreadHistory() to include metadata

4. **Update API documentation**
   - Add OpenAPI specs for new endpoints
   - Update existing endpoint documentation

### Phase 2: Frontend Infrastructure (Priority: High)

5. **Create useConversations hook**
   - `chatbot/src/hooks/useConversations.ts`
   - State management for thread list and current selection
   - CRUD operations for threads

6. **Enhance API client**
   - Add getAllThreads(), createNewThread() functions
   - Update existing functions to handle new response formats

7. **Update type definitions**
   - Enhance conversation and message types
   - Add new thread-related interfaces

### Phase 3: UI Implementation (Priority: Medium)

8. **Enhance Sidebar component**
   - Replace hardcoded conversations with dynamic loading
   - Add "New Thread" button
   - Implement thread selection logic

9. **Update ChatPage component**
   - Load thread history on mount/thread change
   - Handle empty thread states
   - Show thread name in UI

10. **Create new UI components**
    - NewThreadDialog component
    - ThreadListItem component
    - Loading states and error handling

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (Priority: Low)

11. **Thread Management Features**
    - Thread renaming functionality
    - Thread deletion with confirmation
    - Thread search/filtering

12. **UI Polish**
    - Thread indicators (active, unread)
    - Context menus for thread operations
    - Keyboard shortcuts for thread navigation

## Technical Considerations

### Thread Persistence
- **Current**: LangGraph's MemorySaver stores thread state in memory
- **Consideration**: For production, consider persistent storage (database)
- **Recommendation**: Abstract storage layer to allow future database integration

### Thread Naming Strategy
- **Auto-generation**: Extract key words from first user message
- **Fallback**: "New Conversation" + timestamp
- **User customization**: Allow manual renaming

### Performance Optimization
- **Thread list pagination**: For users with many threads
- **Lazy loading**: Load thread history only when selected
- **Caching**: Cache thread metadata in frontend state

### Error Handling
- **Thread not found**: Graceful fallback to new thread
- **API failures**: Show error states, allow retry
- **Concurrent access**: Handle multiple users accessing same thread

## API Specification Updates

### New Endpoints

#### GET /threads
```yaml
/threads:
  get:
    summary: Get all conversation threads
    description: Retrieves a list of all conversation threads with metadata
    tags: [Threads]
    responses:
      200:
        description: List of threads retrieved successfully
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              type: object
              properties:
                threads:
                  type: array
                  items:
                    $ref: '#/components/schemas/ThreadSummary'
      500:
        description: Internal server error
```

#### Enhanced GET /threads/{threadId}
```yaml
/threads/{threadId}:
  get:
    # Enhanced to include thread metadata
    responses:
      200:
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              $ref: '#/components/schemas/ThreadResponse'
```

#### POST /threads (Optional - for explicit creation)
```yaml
/threads:
  post:
    summary: Create a new conversation thread
    requestBody:
      content:
        application/json:
          schema:
            type: object
            properties:
              name:
                type: string
                description: Optional thread name
    responses:
      201:
        description: Thread created successfully
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              type: object
              properties:
                threadId:
                  type: string
```

## Questions for Clarification

Based on the current implementation analysis, I have a few questions:

1. **Thread Storage**: The current implementation uses LangGraph's MemorySaver which stores threads in memory. Should we consider persistent storage (database) for thread metadata, or is the current in-memory approach acceptable?

2. **Thread Naming**: Should thread names be auto-generated from the first message, manually set by users, or both? What's the preferred naming strategy?

3. **Thread Limits**: Should there be a limit on the number of threads per user? If so, what would be reasonable?

4. **Thread Cleanup**: Should old or inactive threads be automatically cleaned up after a certain period?

5. **Thread Organization**: Do you want any categorization or grouping features for threads (e.g., folders, tags, favorites)?

6. **Concurrent Access**: Should multiple users be able to access the same thread, or should threads be user-specific?

The current architecture already has excellent foundations for this feature - the LangGraph checkpointer system with thread_id support makes this implementation straightforward. The main work will be adding the thread management layer and updating the UI to be dynamic rather than hardcoded.
