# Remediation and Enhancement Plan for Guidelines Agent API

This plan addresses the recommendations and known limitations identified in the current API codebase. Each section includes actionable steps, rationale, and suggested deliverables.

---

## 1. Refactor for Modularity and Separation of Concerns

### Actions:
- Analyze current code structure and identify tightly coupled modules.
- Break out logic into smaller, reusable modules (e.g., separate routing, business logic, data access, and utility functions).
- Define clear interfaces and contracts between modules.
- Move configuration and constants to dedicated files.

### Deliverables:
- Refactored directory structure.
- Updated TypeScript interfaces and types.
- Documentation of module boundaries and responsibilities.

---

## 2. Add API Documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger)

### Actions:
- Document all API endpoints, request/response schemas, and error codes.
- Integrate Swagger (or similar) for live API documentation.
- Add usage examples for each endpoint.

### Deliverables:
- OpenAPI/Swagger specification file.
- API documentation accessible via a `/docs` endpoint.

---

## 3. Implement Logging and Error Handling

### Actions:
- Add middleware for request/response logging (consider Winston, Pino, or similar).
- Standardize error handling and response formats.
- Log errors and important events to a persistent store.

### Deliverables:
- Logging and error handling modules.
- Error response documentation.

---

## 4. Add Unit and Integration Tests

### Actions:
- Set up a testing framework (e.g., Jest, Mocha, or similar).
- Write unit tests for all core modules (document loader, prompt templates, workflow, etc.).
- Add integration tests for API endpoints and workflows.
- Establish code coverage targets and reporting.

### Deliverables:
- Test suite with coverage reports.
- CI integration for automated test runs.

---

## 5. Improve Configuration Management

### Actions:
- Move all configuration to environment variables and/or config files.
- Use a library for environment variable management (e.g., dotenv, convict).
- Document all required and optional configuration options.
- Securely manage secrets (avoid hardcoding sensitive data).

### Deliverables:
- Centralized config management module.
- `.env.example` and configuration documentation.

---

## 6. Additional Recommendations

### Actions:
- Add code linting and formatting (ESLint, Prettier).
- Set up pre-commit hooks for code quality.
- Add contribution guidelines and code review process.
- Plan for future scalability (e.g., database migrations, horizontal scaling).

### Deliverables:
- Linting/formatting configuration files.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` and code review checklist.
- Scalability and deployment notes.

---

## Execution Notes
- Each section should be tracked as a separate epic or milestone in project management tools.
- Assign owners and deadlines for each deliverable.
- Review and update this plan as the codebase evolves.

This plan is intended to guide the transition from prototype to enterprise-ready code.
